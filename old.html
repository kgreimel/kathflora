          <p>
            Hello! My name is Craig Schlewitz and I'm an interdisciplinary creative based in St. Paul, MN. After receiving my Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and entering the workforce as a graphic designer and web developer for a local creative agency, I was made aware of Creative Market through a colleague of mine. 
          </p>
          <p>
            With my experience creating and sourcing imagery and digital content for various clients, I've begun creating digital resources that I believe will help speed up and simplify the design and photography process for small business owners and fellow creators alike, as well as target specific problem areas that haven't yet been thoroughly addressed with the products currently listed in the marketplace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below I've included screenshots and a PSD example for a product I'm currently preparing to be sold, entitled Irid – a collection of photo-based publication mockups (for Adobe Photoshop) that feature natural lighting, plants, and botanical shadows. Custom cover and spine designs can be easily swapped out in a few clicks using Smart Objects, and foreground imagery can be toggled on/off using layers. Straying away from the hyper-stylized, studio backdrop-based settings ubiquitous amongst product mockups – the natural sunlight and organic shadows here offer a more personal, realistic ambience. 
          </p>
          <p>
            All in all, I'm passionate about creating and using the knowledge, skills, and stylistic voice I've developed throughout the years to help others, and I believe Creative Market would be a great place to share these things through the opening of my shop, October November. Thank you so much for your consideration and time, and I look forward to hearing from you!
